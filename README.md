# bank-customer-segmentation
The main aim of the ”Bank Customer Segmentation” project is to use smart ways 
to grouping to sort out bank customers based on how they handle their money. This helps in making the
data simpler, finding important patterns, and then splitting customers into different groups. The end goal is to
understand and separate different types of customers, so the bank can create special plans and services
just for them. This way, the bank can make its customers happier and more engaged by offering things that
suit them better.
To cluster customers as affluent, middle-income, or economically poor, you can use a combination of columns and criteria that reflect their financial behavior and status. Here’s a selection of columns and criteria for each category.
